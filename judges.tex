John MacLeod has been trialing sheepdogs for over forty years, working hill farms across the Scottish Highlands. His deep understanding of breeding, training, and livestock management has made him one of the most respected voices in European sheepdog work. John has judged national and international trials in seven countries and is known for his fair, consistent assessments that reward genuine working ability over stylistic trends. He values dogs that think independently, adapt quickly to challenging situations, and maintain calm authority with livestock. His own dogs have won numerous championships, but John remains most proud of those that have gone on to become reliable working partners on remote hill farms. For him, a great sheepdog trial reflects the realities of daily shepherding—where precision, patience, and trust matter above all. John brings decades of practical experience to this championship and looks forward to recognizing excellence in the field.

Marie Dubois grew up on a family farm in the French Pyrenees, where working with sheepdogs was not a sport but a necessity.

Marie has spent the past twenty-five years judging trials across Europe, earning recognition for her ability to identify subtle qualities—balance, timing, and the quiet communication between dog and handler. She believes that the best sheepdogs are not simply obedient but intelligent partners capable of reading livestock and terrain. Marie has served on international judging panels and helped shape modern trial standards that honor traditional working methods. Her own breeding program focuses on temperament and intelligence, producing dogs known for their calm confidence and reliability. Marie approaches judging with respect for both competitors and sheep, understanding that every run represents years of dedication. She is honored to contribute her expertise to this championship.

William O'Connor comes from a long line of Irish shepherds and has worked with border collies his entire life. He began judging trials fifteen years ago and is known for his keen eye for natural ability and sound working style. William values dogs that show initiative without losing connection to their handler, and he appreciates the subtle adjustments that separate competent work from true mastery. His approach to judging emphasizes fairness and clarity, ensuring that handlers understand what is being rewarded and why. William has judged championships throughout Ireland, the United Kingdom, and across Continental Europe. He runs a working farm where sheepdogs are essential daily partners, not show animals. This practical perspective informs his judging philosophy: trials should celebrate the skills that make real farm work possible. William looks for dogs with courage, intelligence, and the rare ability to remain calm under pressure. He considers it a privilege to judge this championship and to witness the exceptional partnership between these handlers and their dogs.
